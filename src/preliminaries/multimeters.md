# How to Use Multimeters

During this step you will learn about how to use multimeters to do a continuity check and a voltage check.    

A multimeter or a multitester, also known as a *VOM* (volt-ohm-milliammeter), is an electronic measuring instrument that combines several measurement functions in one unit. A typical multimeter can measure voltage, current, and resistance.

[This](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter/all) is a general tutorial for multimeters.

```{attention}
Please turn off the multimeter by setting the dial to `OFF` after you finish your check.

## Continuity Check

In electronics, a continuity check is a test of the resistance between any two points of a circuit (that it is in fact a complete circuit). If there is zero resistance between two points, then there is a **short** between the points. Shorts are potentially dangerous because they may cause far too much current to flow throughout the circuit - thus resulting in the circuit frying due to heat generated by Joule effect.

```{note}
There might be slight differences with your multimeter model, but the general instructions should be very similar.
```

Performing a continuity check is a safe way to debug if a circuit has an undesired short because the check does not require a power source to be connected to the circuit.

1. Select the Continuity Function
    
    * Turn the multimeter dial to the continuity test position. Then press the `"FUNC."` button to switch to the continuity test mode (indicated by an icon that looks like a sound wave).

        | Continuity test dial position | Continuity test mode |
        |:-----------------------------:|:---------------------:
        |![](../_images/multimeters/multimeter_dial_continuity_inked.jpg) | ![](../_images/multimeters/multimeter_continuity_mode_inked.jpg) 

    * Test the continuity test mode by touching and holding the multimeter leads together. A continuous beep will be audible for as long as the leads are held together. 

        ```{figure} ../_images/multimeters/multimeter_leads_together_inked.jpg

        ```

2. Perform the Continuity Check  

    * Place each lead at a point of the circuit or component you want to test.   

        ```{figure} ../_images/multimeters/multimeter_leads_on_board.jpg

        ```

    * If the path between the two points is continuous (i.e. is a short), then the screen will display a value of zero (or near zero) and the multimeter will emit a continuous beep for as long as the leads are held in place.
    
    ```{note}
    If you hear a short beep followed by silence while the leads are held in place, then you can safely ignore the short beep.
    ```

```{admonition} General Continuity Check Strategy
:class: tip

* Check every two positive (`+`) terminals to make sure every pair of these terminals is continuous.

* Check every two negative (`-`) terminals to make sure every pair of these terminals is continuous.

* Check every positive terminal (`+`) to make sure it is **not continuous** with any negative terminal ('-').

## DC Voltage Check

1. **Selecting the DC Voltage Mode**  
    Switch on your multimeter, and set the dial to DC voltage mode (indicated by a `V` with a straight line `-V`, or the symbol `⎓`).   

    ```{figure} ../_images/multimeters/multimeter_dial_dc_voltage.jpg

    Switch the Dial to the DC Voltage Test Function
    ```

2. **Performing the Voltage Check**  
    * Place the positive (i.e. red) lead on a positive (`+`) terminal, and the negative (i.e. black) lead on the negative (`-`) terminal.  
    * See the screen for a voltage measurement.   

```{note}
Reversing the leads (i.e. red on `-` and black on `+`) won't do any harm; it will simply give a negative reading of the same magnitude.
